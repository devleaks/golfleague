competition setup. Use other mthod to build flight manually (create + add/remove
golfer).


## Misc

Ties and Tie breaks. Work around: Simple tie_break column in scorecard.

Starter: Simultaneous starts from 2 holes. Work around: Do 2 matches, reassemble them in Tournament.

Complicated: Simultaneous competition on 2 courses? Tournette En/Am. = 2 matches, 1 tournament?
