Yii Golf League Environment
===========================

Before we can have fun organising competitions, we need to enter a few basic
data.

We need to provide

-   At least one golf League,

-   A few golfers,

-   A golf facility and at least one golf course.

This is a minimum requirement.

 

The Golf League
---------------

The first entity we need to create is the golf League.

A single installation of Yii Golf League can host one or more golf leagues.

| Items not in league      | Items private to a league  | Items that can be retricted to a league or not |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Facilities, golf courses | Golfers, competitions      | Competition rules, events, messages            |
