Yii Golf League
===============

Yii Golf League is a web application for running a golf league.

The application is suitable for a single, small golf leagues run by a few friends, or a large, club-based league run by a golf coordinator.

A single installation of the application can host one or more leagues.

Each league can have its own, private area, while some elements such as golf courses are available across all leagues.

The web application has 2 sides run on the same computer server but accessed by two different URL.

The first side is for managing the league: Creating competitions, confirming registration, preparing flight start lists, and reporting scores.

The second side is for golfers, to view league and site news, and calendars of competitions, register to competitions, print custom scorecards, and view scoreboards.
